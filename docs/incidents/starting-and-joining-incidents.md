# Starting an Incident

To start an incident, use one of the following steps:

- Use the slash command */incident start* from any channel.
- Select the shield icon in the channel header, and click **+ Start Incident**.
- Use the context menu of a post and select **Start incident**.

You need to select a playbook and name your incident before you can select **Start Incident**. The incident description is optional. Only playbooks that you're a member of are listed in the **Playbook** drop-down menu.

The creator of an incident is automatically added as the first member and becomes the commander. To change commanders, click the current commander's name in the RHS and select the new commander. Only members of the channel may be selected as commanders. To change commander to a user who is not in the channel, first add the user to the channel.
