package config

// Configuration captures the plugin's external configuration as exposed in the Mattermost server
// configuration, as well as values computed from the configuration. Any public fields will be
// deserialized from the Mattermost server configuration in OnConfigurationChange.
//
// As plugins are inherently concurrent (hooks being called asynchronously), and the plugin
// configuration can change at any time, access to the configuration must be synchronized. The
// strategy used in this plugin is to guard a pointer to the configuration, and clone the entire
// struct whenever it changes. You may replace this with whatever strategy you choose.
//
// If you add non-reference types to your configuration struct, be sure to rewrite Clone as a deep
// copy appropriate for your types.
type Configuration struct {
	// ** The following are NOT stored on the server
	// AdminUserIDs contains a list of user IDs that are allowed
	// to administer plugin functions, even if not Mattermost sysadmins.
	AllowedUserIDs []string

	// BotUserID used to post messages.
	BotUserID string

	// AdminLogLevel is "debug", "info", "warn", or "error".
	AdminLogLevel string

	// AdminLogVerbose: set to include full context with admin log messages.
	AdminLogVerbose bool

// Clone shallow copies the configuration. Your implementation may require a deep copy if
// your configuration has reference types.
